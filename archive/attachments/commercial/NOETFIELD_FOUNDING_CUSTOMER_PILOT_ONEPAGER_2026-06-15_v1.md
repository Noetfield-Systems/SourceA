# Noetfield — Founding Customer Pilot

### Runtime governance for AI agents — provable, per-action, replayable
*2026-06-15 · v1 · one-pager for design-partner outreach*

---

**The problem.** Your agents are in production. Most teams' agents act without provable control — policy is checked once at session start, if at all, and when something goes wrong there's no signed record of what the agent was allowed to do, what it did, or whether the log was tampered with. Static, session-level governance is no longer enough. Regulators, boards, and your own incident reviews now ask a question most stacks can't answer: *prove what every agent action was permitted to do, and prove the record is intact.*

**What Noetfield does.** Noetfield governs agent execution **before the model acts**. Every action is gated by policy at dispatch, written to a signed, replayable receipt ledger, and protected by tamper detection — so each decision is enforced in real time and provable after the fact.

**The proof — in under five minutes.** Not a slide. A live chain you can watch end to end:

> **request → policy evaluation → decision → enforcement → signed receipt → replay → tamper-FAIL → signed audit chain**

You'll see an action **blocked**, an action **allowed**, a tampered record **fail verification**, and the whole sequence **replayed** from the signed ledger. Most governance tools describe this. We run it in front of you, cold start, in five minutes.

## Founding-customer pilot

| Term | What it is |
|---|---|
| **Price** | CAD $2,000 deposit — **refunded if we don't deliver the agreed metric** |
| **Duration** | 30–60 days |
| **Mode** | **Shadow** — runs alongside your existing stack, zero production risk |
| **Scope** | One workflow / one agent fleet |
| **Success metric** | One number, agreed up front (e.g. *% of agent actions policy-gated with full audit replay*, or *policy violations caught that your current setup missed*) |
| **Conversion** | Hit the metric → pilot converts to an annual at a pre-agreed founding price |

As a founding customer you get founding pricing, direct roadmap input, and priority support — in exchange for a reference and a case study if the pilot succeeds.

## Why now
Most enterprises now run agents in production; most lack formal governance; a large share of agentic projects are projected to fail on weak risk controls. The gap between *agents acting* and *agents provably controlled* is the risk on your desk right now. Noetfield closes it at the execution layer.

**Next step:** a 15-minute live walkthrough of the full governance-receipt chain. We can run it in shadow mode against your environment immediately after.
